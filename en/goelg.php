			<p>Goelg is a splash page for one of my electronic music projects. It was created to test the <i>three.js</i>-technology,
				which has been used to make the spinning cube on the site. I've also utilized <a href="https://www.toneden.io/player">the ToneDen Soundcloud Player</a>, because
				I felt like Soundcloud's own embeddable player is a bit clunky. The mobile view of the site has a link to the Soundcloud page, because I feel like
				mobile sites, from an usability viewpoint, aren't very good for embedded players. (Even though ToneDen's player would work on newest mobile devices)

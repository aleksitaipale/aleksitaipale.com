			<p>Lyrae is a lyric sharing website for me and my friend. Both of us have our own accounts there and by logging in we can submit
				lyrics to the site. The lyrics are saved to <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>, which will accept lyrics only if you're logged in with
				an authenticated account. The site is also mobile-friendly. As a small curiosity, the colors of the site are choosed semi-randomly (from a certain color palette) every time you load
				the site.

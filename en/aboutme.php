			<h2>Who?</h2>
			<p>	I'm a second year information networks student at Aalto University. Before my studies I hadn't really programmed,
				but technology has always been close to my heart. In my personal projects I've been more focused on front-end development, 
				but I'm not afraid of back-end either. I strive to create things that are easy and comfortable to use - the appearance is just a part of the whole.
				<br><br>
				In the end I feel like the leading role in technology is played by humans - machines do things but (at least for time being!)
				humans are the ones who run the show. That's why I see the role of people as quintessential in tech projects
				 - communication with the users and other team members is important. As a developer it's easy to get caught up in
				 gimmicks, but that's often very far from what the user wants.
				<br><br>
				Besides coding and web design I love making music in different ways (e.g. saxophone, computer). I also dig watching movies.</p>

			<p>My own homepage. Styled with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> (which was compiled with <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>) and
				<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/grid.html">Foundation Grid</a>. I also used some PHP to avoid code repetition. The pictures are scaled according to the
				user device using <a href="https://github.com/teleject/hisrc">hisrc</a>, so that mobile users won't have to download
				large files in vain. There was a lot of new technology involved in the making of this site (Grunt, Sass, Foundation),
				but in the end I feel like they just streamlined the process after I learned how to use them.
